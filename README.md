## In Defence of Public Transport - Bettering Our Public Transport Systems Through Strategic Resource Allocation

## Problem Statement
In Singapore, efficient and accessible public transportation plays a critical role facilitating mobile and connectivity across regions, contributing to the residents’ overall quality of life. However, with increasing urbanisation and population density, there is a growing need to identify commuter hubs and evaluate the accessibility of public transport services to ensure efficient access to all residents.

Additionally, despite longer travelling times through private transport due to road congestion during peak hours for most, many are still deceived or would still utilise private transport for the sake of comfort and convenience. Not only does heavy reliance on private transport contribute significantly to pollution, it also leads to depletion of finite natural resources such as oil and gas.

For public transport to trump private, efficiency is not the only focal point. There is also a need for improved comfort and accessibility for commuters to make the switch, or have their journeys be more bearable.

## Objective
Our project aims to elevate public transport to the preferred mode of commuting by enhancing the efficiency, comfort, and convenience of trains and buses in Singapore. Building onto this, we aim to improve LTA’s resource allocation by forecasting demand needed for public transport throughout the day.
